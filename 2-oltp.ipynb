    "Now so far in structuring our databases, we have developed a schema for an online transactional processing database (OLTP).  This is the relational database design of most web applications.  It's a database structure that optimizes for an updating record of user transactions -- where say we update the record of transactions multiple times a second.  \n",

    "Online transactional processing is meant for databases that are *transactional*.  For example, the database of any consumer facing website is transactional.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So then what databases are not *transactional*? Well a database used for analytics does not have a lot of transactions.  Instead, we simply copy over the data in our OLTP to another database, and perform queries on it.  But instead of users interacting with our database multiple times a second, we will not really update and insert data other than bulk copying additional data, maybe on a daily basis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that our OLTP database serves a different goal than our analytical database.  The OLTP may be used confurrently by hundreds of users.  It needs to accomodate for high throughput and is insert and update-intensive.  So one of the main goals with an OLTP is speedy updates and reads.\n",

    "We serve this goal by having tables that are relatively small -- say 5-7 columns or fewer, which speeds up our read and write transactions. \n",

So if we are creating a database to manage doctors appointments, we make sure that we are only listing a doctor or patient's name in one record.  If we need to reference that doctor or patient, say in an appointment, we instead just reference the `patient_id`.  And of course, the same goes for the doctor."

We saw that the database structure organizes our data into tables with a small number of columns, which provides for fast inserts and updates to our data.  With an OLTP, we prevent duplicating information, promoting a single source of truth.  And when we achieve this, our data is in third normal form.  An added benefit of this is that the non-key columns (fact columns) in a table are directly related to the information in the primary key. "
